# Cosmic - The Framework for the Agentic Game Engine

## Vision & Mission

Our mission is to empower game developers to build better games through agentic co-creation, reimagining what game development can be.

The future of game development is part human, part AI - building game assets which are modular and dynamic and empowered by agentic processes, specialised generative tools and onchain economies.

We believe combining human imagination and AI workflows will drive forward novel innovation in game development.

## Why We're Here

Most indie game developers begin their journey to bring play to the world, create art, and tell stories. However, current development approaches present significant barriers:

- Games are hard to build requiring specialized skills and significant time investment
- Games are hard to monetize limiting sustainable development
- It's hard to grow communities hindering growth and engagement
- It's hard to execute the vision between creative ideas and technical implementation

<Callout type="warning">
These limitations make it difficult for new developers to create innovative indie games that are financially sustainable. The high cost of building and launching causes many brilliant ideas to remain unrealized.

## The AI Game Engine Approach

Cosmic introduces an AI game engine approach, a game development framework and front-end development interface which using specialist agents orchestrated like a traditional game studio.

Through developer prompting, these agents will be able to co-create with you to generate assets, game mechanics, environments, and economies not previously pre-coded in the game. This isn't just vibe coding, it's accelerating real game development processes.

We're starting with PotNoodleDev, a specialised game developer agent who you can use in your IDE and game development processes. The first of many agentic collaborators and tools within the Cosmic stack.

## The Potential of Agentic Game engines & Living Games

We believe building games with Agents at the core will change the way we build, modify and play games. A new frontier for game play and game mechanics not previously imagined. AI thinks, communicates, and plays on a whole different level from us, we believe we'll see novel game design that emerges from AI and human experimentation.

The end goal is a future of living games that can recode their own assets, mechanics, environments, and economies as people play them. This is not just unplayable chaos, but games designed by humans and agents which are truly fun to play.

## Why PotNoodleDev?

PotNoodleDev embodies the vibe coding mentality, part human and part agent - a game developer agent and headless game studio where anyone can build with our stack, launch games and earn $NOODS.

We're starting with Idle, Capitalist Adventure, and Factorio games.

<Callout type="warning">
PotNoodleDev is not owned by a big gaming studio, or shadowy publishers under the hood. There's no pre-sale. PotNoodleDev is created by the holders of $NOODS, who can create value under the shared vision of living games.
