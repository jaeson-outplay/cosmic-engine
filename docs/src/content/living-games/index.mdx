# Living Games: The Future of Game Development

Welcome to the Living Games documentation. This guide explores the revolutionary approach of creating games through agentic development workflows, where games evolve and grow through the collaboration between human developers and AI agents.

## Core Concepts

Living Games represent a paradigm shift in game development, where games are:
- **Evolving**: Continuously growing and adapting based on player interaction and feedback
- **Agent-Driven**: Leveraging AI agents for various aspects of development
- **Systems-Based**: Built on interconnected systems that create emergent gameplay
- **Community-Centered**: Shaped by player communities and their interactions
